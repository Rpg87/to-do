This is a simple task manager application built with React. The application is organized into components for better maintainability and modularity. Below is an overview of the project structure and key features.

## Project Structure

### 1. App Component (App.js)

The App component serves as the main entry point for the application. It includes two child components: **Logo** and **TasksList**.

<details open= 'open'> <summary>  </summary> 
<img width= '600px'  src="src/images/app.png" />
</details>

### 2. Form Component (Form.js)

The **Form** component handles task input and submission. It uses React hooks for state management and generates unique task IDs using the **uuid** library.

<details open= 'open'> <summary>  </summary> 
<img width= '600px'  src="src/images/form.png" />
</details>

### 3. Tasks Component (Tasks.js)

The **Tasks** component represents an individual task and manages interactions related to that specific task. It allows users to mark the task as complete or delete it.

<details open= 'open'> <summary>  </summary>

</details>

### 4. TasksList Component (TasksList.js)

The **TaskList** component oversees the entire list of tasks. It provides the capability to add new tasks to the list through the **Form** component. Additionally, it enables the deletion of tasks and marking specific tasks as complete.
